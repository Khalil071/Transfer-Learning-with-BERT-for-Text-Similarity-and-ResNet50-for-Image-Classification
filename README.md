Transfer Learning with BERT for Text Similarity and ResNet50 for Image Classification
This project demonstrates how to apply transfer learning using two powerful pre-trained models: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for calculating cosine similarity between text data, and ResNet50 for image classification. These models are fine-tuned on their respective tasks and can be easily adapted for further use in various NLP and computer vision applications.

Project Overview
Text Similarity with BERT: We use the pre-trained bert-large-uncased model to represent text data as embeddings and calculate the cosine similarity between pairs of sentences or documents.
Image Classification with ResNet50: We leverage the pre-trained ResNet50 model, fine-tuned for the task of image classification, to classify images into different categories.
Requirements
The following libraries are required for running the project:

tensorflow (for ResNet50 model and Keras)
transformers (for BERT and Hugging Face utilities)
scikit-learn (for calculating cosine similarity)
numpy (for numerical operations)
matplotlib (for visualizing the results)
PIL (for image loading and preprocessing)
pandas (optional, for data manipulation)
To install the required libraries, run:

bash

File Structure
The project consists of the following main files:

text_similarity.py: Demonstrates how to use BERT (bert-large-uncased) for calculating the cosine similarity between text pairs.
image_classification.py: Demonstrates how to use ResNet50 for image classification.
1. Text Similarity with BERT (text_similarity.py)
In this section, we use the BERT-large-uncased model for computing text embeddings and calculating cosine similarity between text pairs. The BERT model is fine-tuned for sentence-level embeddings and can be used to measure the similarity between two pieces of text.

Example Code:
python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Load BERT tokenizer and model (BERT-large-uncased)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-large-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-large-uncased')

# Function to get BERT embeddings for a given text
def get_bert_embeddings(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).detach().numpy()  # Mean pooling to get a single vector

# Sample text pairs
text1 = "I love machine learning."
text2 = "I enjoy learning about artificial intelligence."

# Get BERT embeddings
embedding1 = get_bert_embeddings(text1)
embedding2 = get_bert_embeddings(text2)

# Calculate cosine similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)
print(f"Cosine Similarity: {similarity[0][0]:.4f}")
Explanation:
BERT Embeddings: The text is tokenized and passed through the BERT model to obtain embeddings. These embeddings represent the meaning of the text in a high-dimensional space.
Cosine Similarity: The cosine similarity measure is used to compute the similarity between the embeddings of the two text samples.
Example Output:
bash

Cosine Similarity: 0.9285
2. Image Classification with ResNet50 (image_classification.py)
In this section, we use the ResNet50 model pre-trained on ImageNet for image classification tasks. The ResNet50 model is a deep convolutional neural network designed to handle large-scale image classification tasks with high accuracy.

Example Code:
python
Copy
Edit
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
import numpy as np

# Load pre-trained ResNet50 model
model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

# Load and preprocess the image
img_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'  # Replace with the path to your image
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))  # ResNet50 requires 224x224 images
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)

# Make prediction
predictions = model.predict(img_array)

# Decode predictions to class labels
decoded_predictions = decode_predictions(predictions, top=3)[0]
for i, (imagenet_id, label, score) in enumerate(decoded_predictions):
    print(f"{i+1}: {label} with probability {score:.2f}")
Explanation:
ResNet50: The ResNet50 model is loaded with weights pre-trained on ImageNet. This allows the model to classify images based on the features it has learned from the ImageNet dataset.
Image Preprocessing: The input image is resized to 224x224 pixels, converted into a numerical array, and preprocessed before feeding it into the ResNet50 model.
Predictions: The model predicts the class probabilities for the input image, and the top 3 predictions are decoded to readable class labels.
Example Output:
bash

1: tabby, tabby cat with probability 0.85
2: Egyptian cat with probability 0.10
3: tiger cat with probability 0.03
Training and Fine-Tuning
Although the models used in this project are pre-trained on large datasets (BERT on a massive text corpus and ResNet50 on ImageNet), they can be further fine-tuned for specific tasks or domains by retraining the last layers on your custom datasets.

Fine-tuning BERT for Text Classification:
You can fine-tune BERT for specific NLP tasks such as text classification or sentiment analysis by adding task-specific layers on top of the pre-trained model and training them on your labeled data.

Fine-tuning ResNet50 for Custom Image Classification:
You can also fine-tune ResNet50 for custom image classification tasks by freezing the initial layers and training the final layers on your labeled image dataset.

Results and Evaluation
For text similarity, you can evaluate the cosine similarity between pairs of text to assess their semantic similarity. For image classification, evaluate the top-1 accuracy of the model on a test set of images.

Visualizations (Optional):
You may also plot the predictions using matplotlib to visualize the results of image classification or display the similarity scores in a heatmap.
