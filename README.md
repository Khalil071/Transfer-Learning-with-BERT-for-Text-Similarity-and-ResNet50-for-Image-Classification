Transfer Learning with BERT for Text Similarity
This project demonstrates how to apply transfer learning using two powerful pre-trained models: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for calculating cosine similarity between text data, and ResNet50 for image classification. These models are fine-tuned on their respective tasks and can be easily adapted for further use in various NLP and computer vision applications.

Project Overview
Text Similarity with BERT: We use the pre-trained bert-large-uncased model to represent text data as embeddings and calculate the cosine similarity between pairs of sentences or documents.
Image Classification with ResNet50: We leverage the pre-trained ResNet50 model, fine-tuned for the task of image classification, to classify images into different categories.
Requirements
The following libraries are required for running the project:

tensorflow (for ResNet50 model and Keras)
transformers (for BERT and Hugging Face utilities)
scikit-learn (for calculating cosine similarity)
numpy (for numerical operations)
matplotlib (for visualizing the results)
PIL (for image loading and preprocessing)
pandas (optional, for data manipulation)
To install the required libraries, run:

bash

Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
File Structure
The project consists of the following main files:

text_similarity.py: Demonstrates how to use BERT (bert-large-uncased) for calculating the cosine similarity between text pairs.
image_classification.py: Demonstrates how to use ResNet50 for image classification.
1. Text Similarity with BERT (text_similarity.py)
In this section, we use the BERT-large-uncased model for computing text embeddings and calculating cosine similarity between text pairs. The BERT model is fine-tuned for sentence-level embeddings and can be used to measure the similarity between two pieces of text.

Example Code:
python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Load BERT tokenizer and model (BERT-large-uncased)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-large-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-large-uncased')

# Function to get BERT embeddings for a given text
def get_bert_embeddings(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).detach().numpy()  # Mean pooling to get a single vector

# Sample text pairs
text1 = "I love machine learning."
text2 = "I enjoy learning about artificial intelligence."

# Get BERT embeddings
embedding1 = get_bert_embeddings(text1)
embedding2 = get_bert_embeddings(text2)

# Calculate cosine similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)
print(f"Cosine Similarity: {similarity[0][0]:.4f}")
Explanation:
BERT Embeddings: The text is tokenized and passed through the BERT model to obtain embeddings. These embeddings represent the meaning of the text in a high-dimensional space.
Cosine Similarity: The cosine similarity measure is used to compute the similarity between the embeddings of the two text samples.
Example Output:

Cosine Similarity: 0.9285

Fine-tuning BERT for Text Classification:
You can fine-tune BERT for specific NLP tasks such as text classification or sentiment analysis by adding task-specific layers on top of the pre-trained model and training them on your labeled data.

Results and Evaluation
For text similarity, you can evaluate the cosine similarity between pairs of text to assess their semantic similarity.

Visualizations (Optional):
You may also plot the predictions using matplotlib to display the similarity scores in a heatmap.
